As the files are text-based guides for creating a game in Unity, they do not have shared dependencies in the traditional sense of software development (like exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names). 

However, they do share common themes, concepts, and terminologies related to Unity game development. These include:

1. Unity Terminology: Terms like "Scene", "Assets", "Objects", "Scripts", "Physics", "Audio", "Animations", "UI", "Building", "Debugging", and "Publishing" are common across the files.

2. Unity Software: All files depend on the Unity software and its features.

3. Game Development Process: The files follow a sequential order, mirroring the steps of game development in Unity.

4. User Interaction: The files assume the user's interaction with Unity's interface and the ability to follow the guide.

5. Unity Version: The guide's instructions may depend on the version of Unity being used.

6. Operating System: The setup and operation of Unity can vary between different operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux), which is a shared consideration across the files. 

7. Programming Language: Unity uses C# for scripting, which is a shared dependency across the files that involve code (like "AddingScripts.txt" and "Debugging.txt").
